# Code-Reactors

Our idea is software based web, which is hosted at http://code-reactors.epizy.com/

## Description
Our website is having a simple UI, where users can interact with it responsively. We have divided the website into three user responsiveness.  One is the user(patient), second is the hospital and third is the medical Stores. Our team decided to work on this idea because of pandemic situation we had seen in past is worse and people didn't have live data about the resources. Using this solution in future we have can prevent such things.
Using this website everyone gets the live data of available beds as well as insulin information. Registered user can book an appointment for the bed which is approved by the hospital.
